<h1>About Me</h1>

Hi, I’m Martin.

I hail from Rosario, Argentina. Though, I've spent two years in Buenos Aires, Argentina where I worked as BI Analyst.

I currently live in Dublin, doing a 3-month English course and in the pursuit of my first professional experience as a data scienctist.

I've completed a Master degree in Industrial Engineering with an excellent background in Math, Statistic and Computer Science (it was here that I realized my passion about data and programming).

In the past, I've worked in different positions such as BI analyst, director manager, quality management intern and production and maintenance intern, and also in different fields like ecommerce, brewery and steel factory. Although I've never had the possibility to work as a Data Scientist, in most of them I've developed and applied projects related to it.
